# Unity-Semester6-Assignment-1

This is an assignment I did at Sheridan College during my final year in the Software Development and Network Engineering program.
Please note that this project uses the new Universal Render Pipeline (URP), and will require a version of Unity that supoorts it (this project
was created using version 2020.1.17f1, however has been updated to 2020.3.40f1, so I would recommand using the same version to ensure best results).
